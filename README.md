# Swift for Tensorflow Docker stacks

## Overview

![Swift for Tensorflow Docker image stack hierarchy](docker-image-hierarchy.svg)

`blockdiag -T svg docker-image-hierarchy.diag`

## Project goals

1. Replicate all of the functionality of Google's Swift for Tensorflow images (shown on the left in [the overview diagram](#project-goals))
1. Replicate some of the functionality (the library support, not additional application support) of Jupyter's Docker Stacks images (shown on the right in [the overview diagram](#project-goals))
